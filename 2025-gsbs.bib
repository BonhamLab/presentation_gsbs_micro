  abstract = {Preclinical evidence has firmly established bidirectional interactions among the brain, the gut, and the gut microbiome. Candidate signaling molecules and at least three communication channels have been identified. Communication within this system is nonlinear, is bidirectional with multiple feedback loops, and likely involves interactions between different channels. Alterations in gut–brain–microbiome interactions have been identified in rodent models of several digestive, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. While alterations in gut–brain interactions have clearly been established in irritable bowel syndrome, a causative role of the microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome remains to be determined. In the absence of specific microbial targets for more effective therapies, current approaches are limited to dietary interventions and centrally targeted pharmacological and behavioral approaches. A more comprehensive understanding of causative influences within the gut–brain–microbiome system and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to translate these exciting preclinical findings into effective therapies.},

  abstract = {Infant microbiome assembly has been intensely studied in infants from industrialized nations, but little is known about this process in nonindustrialized populations. We deeply sequenced infant stool samples from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania and analyzed them in a global meta-analysis. Infant microbiomes develop along lifestyle-associated trajectories, with more than 20\% of genomes detected in the Hadza infant gut representing novel species. Industrialized infants—even those who are breastfed—have microbiomes characterized by a paucity of Bifidobacterium infantis and gene cassettes involved in human milk utilization. Strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups are shared between mother-infant dyads, consistent with early life inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes. The population-specific differences in infant microbiome composition and function underscore the importance of studying microbiomes from people outside of wealthy, industrialized nations.},

  abstract = {Free oligosaccharides are abundant components of mammalian milk and have primary roles as prebiotic compounds, in immune defense, and in brain development. Mass spectrometry-based technique is applied to profile milk oligosaccharides from apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, and siamang), new world monkeys (golden lion tamarin and common marmoset), and an old world monkey (rhesus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patterns of primate milk oligosaccharide composition from a phylogenetic perspective in order to assess the extent to which the compositions of hMOs derives from ancestral, primate patterns as opposed to more recent evolutionary events. Milk oligosaccharides were quantitated by nanoflow liquid chromatography on chip-based devices. The relative abundances of fucosylated and sialylated milk oligosaccharides in primates were also determined. For a systematic and comprehensive study of evolutionary patterns of milk oligosaccharides, cluster analysis of primate milk was performed using the chromatographic profile. In general, the oligosaccharides in primate milk, including humans, are more complex and exhibit greater diversity compared to the ones in non-primate milk. A detailed comparison of the oligosaccharides across evolution revealed non-sequential developmental pattern, i.e. that primate milk oligosaccharides do not necessarily cluster according to the primate phylogeny. This report represents the first comprehensive and quantitative effort to profile and elucidate the structures of free milk oligosaccharides so that they can be related to glycan function in different primates.},
